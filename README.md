**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments:
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-05-upside/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

üîí Global Liquidity Withdrawal Timer

‚Ä¢	The withdrawLiquidity function uses a global cooldown timer.

‚Ä¢	Once this timer is triggered and expires, the Owner can withdraw liquidity from all MetaCoins, both past and future.

‚Ä¢	This behavior is by design and not scoped per MetaCoin.

üíµ Liquidity Token is Assumed to be USDC

‚Ä¢	INITIAL_LIQUIDITY_RESERVES is hardcoded to 10_000 * 10^6, assuming USDC with 6 decimals.

üîÅ Swap Function Reentrancy Consideration

‚Ä¢	The swap() function makes external token transfers (e.g., transfer, approve).

‚Ä¢	Reentrancy guards are intentionally omitted, relying instead on the assumption that only trusted tokens (USDC, MetaCoins) are used.

‚Ä¢	Given this closed token set, reentrancy is not considered a practical risk.

üßæ Zero-Value Claims & Transfers

‚Ä¢	Both the protocol and deployer can call claim* functions even if their claimable balance is 0.

ü™™ Token Name Changes & Permit Compatibility

‚Ä¢	Owners can call setNameAndSymbol() to update the name/symbol of a MetaCoin.

‚Ä¢	This may break ERC20 Permit compatibility due to EIP-712 domain separation relying on the name() value.

‚Ä¢	Integrators using permit() should handle potential mismatches or restrict tokens that have changed their name.

# Additional context

## Areas of concern (where to focus for bugs)
None

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Main invariants

Only the Owner can: set fee parameters, set staking contract address, claim protocol fees, change name/symbol of a MetaCoin, disable whitelist, withdraw liquidity, set tokenization fees and whitelist addresses for transfer.

Tokenization of a URL can only happen once. Tokens are deployed with a fixed initial supply and reserves.

MetaCoin transfers are restricted by whitelist unless explicitly disabled by the Owner. The Owner can permanently disable the whitelist for any MetaCoin.

Reserves for liquidityToken and MetaCoin are always updated after each swap. Sell swaps should never drop below INITIAL_LIQUIDITY_RESERVES.

Fee revenue is accumulated and must be claimed explicitly by the deployer or Owner. Transfers of claimable fees are never automatic.

Liquidity withdrawal is restricted by a global cooldown mechanism. Once triggered, the Owner must wait 14 days before a withdrawal can be completed.
